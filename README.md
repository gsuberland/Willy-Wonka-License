# Willy Wonka Software License

This license is a combination of the license from [the lobby scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaMmAFLm5EI) and the contract from the ["Good day, sir!" scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpK36FZmTFY) of the 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.

In line with Willy Wonka's own sense of absurdity, this license is itself licensed under the MIT license.
